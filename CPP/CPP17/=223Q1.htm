<meta data-rh="true" name="description" content="The leading site for self-help Internet radio shows focusing on ADHD and ADD including managing symptoms of attention deficit disorder, adults with ADD, or adults who have children with ADHD. Our weekly Internet radio podcasts provide support for ADHD and ADD. Attention Talk Radio, hosted by Jeff Copper, attention and ADHD coach, is topical with an emphasis on paying attention to what is being paid attention to and what isn&#x27;t being focused on (paid attention to). The point is to put a spotlight on ATTENTION, the role it plays in determining what is obvious, and how it drives outcomes and to shift your paradigm (what you pay attention to), opening your mind to new solutions. The show is designed to help adults and children (particularly those diagnosed with or impacted by attention deficit disorder or attention deficit disorder symptoms) in life or business who are stuck, overwhelmed, or frustrated. It will help adults and children with the symptoms of ADHD and ADD get unstuck and moving forward by helping to open their minds and pay attention to what works. Listen to Attention Talk Radio online for help and information for adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder."/><meta data-rh="true" property="og:type" content="Article"/><meta data-rh="true" property="og:url" content="https://radiopublic.com/attention-talk-radio-WoPqD4"/><meta data-rh="true" property="og:image" content="https://spotlight.radiopublic.com/images/thumbnail?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdasg7xwmldix6.cloudfront.net%2Fhostpics%2Fretina%2Febd031c3-c4cb-4101-b896-80a7f3832c92_atrlogo_for_btr1400x1400.jpg"/><meta data-rh="true" property="og:title" content="Attention Talk Radio"/><meta data-rh="true" property="twitter:card" content="summary"/><meta data-rh="true" property="twitter:site" content="@RadioPublic"/><meta data-rh="true" property="twitter:app:country" content="US"/><meta data-rh="true" property="twitter:app:name:iphone" content="RadioPublic"/><meta data-rh="true" property="twitter:app:id:iphone" content="1113752736"/><meta data-rh="true" property="twitter:app:url:iphone" content="radiopublic://radiopublic.com/attention-talk-radio-WoPqD4"/><meta data-rh="true" property="twitter:app:name:googleplay" content="RadioPublic"/><meta data-rh="true" property="twitter:app:id:googleplay" content="com.radiopublic.android"/><meta data-rh="true" property="twitter:app:url:googleplay" content="https://radiopublic.com/attention-talk-radio-WoPqD4"/><meta data-rh="true" property="og:description" content="The leading site for self-help Internet radio shows focusing on ADHD and ADD including managing symptoms of attention deficit disorder, adults with ADD, or adults who have children with ADHD.

In this episode we focus on sex, intimacy, and masturbation in the context of attention. As we’ve learned from Dr. Tuckman, some of the treatment for folks with low libido involves mindfulness, or attention training, to notice those passing sexual thoughts, feelings, desires, or fantasies and then amplify them. This obviously ties in to masturbation. Sex involves shifting attention as well, because we shift from attending to our partner's pleasure to shifting back to our own physical sensations and mental fantasies. In the context of attention, masturbation is simpler because you don't need to attend to another person and can focus on your own physical and fantasy experience. If this is true and done with intention, can sex and masturbation be used as a mindfulness exercise to help those with ADHD regulate attention?

In this episode we focus on sex, intimacy, and masturbation in the context of attention. As we’ve learned from Dr. Tuckman, some of the treatment for folks with low libido involves mindfulness, or attention training, to notice those passing sexual thoughts, feelings, desires, or fantasies and then amplify them. This obviously ties in to masturbation. Sex involves shifting attention as well, because we shift from attending to our partner's pleasure to shifting back to our own physical sensations and mental fantasies. In the context of attention, masturbation is simpler because you don't need to attend to another person and can focus on your own physical and fantasy experience. If this is true and done with intention, can sex and masturbation be used as a mindfulness exercise to help those with ADHD regulate attention?
